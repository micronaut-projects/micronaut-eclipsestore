The API path is `/eclipsestore` by default.

NOTE: When multiple storage managers are defined, the URL must be suffixed by the manager name `/eclipsestore/«storage-name»`.

This prefix can be configured via the configuration.

[source,yaml]
.src/main/resources/application.yml
----
eclipsestore:
  rest:
    path: custom-prefix
----

The above configuration would expose the REST API at `/custom-prefix`. (or `/custom-prefix/«storage-name»` if you have multiple storage managers defined).
