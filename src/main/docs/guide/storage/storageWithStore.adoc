The following example shows how an equivalent implementation which leverages the <<annotations, Micronaut EclipseStore annotations>> to simplify object storage.

snippet::io.micronaut.eclipsestore.docs.CustomerRepositoryStoreImpl[tags=clazz]

<1> You can also inject an instance of api:eclipsestore.RootProvider[] to easily access the EclipseStore Root Instance. If your Micronaut application has only a single EclipseStore Instance, you don't need to specify a name qualifier to inject it.
<2> https://docs.eclipsestore.io/manual/storage/storing-data/index.html[The rule is: "The Object that has been modified has to be stored!"].
<3> https://docs.eclipsestore.io/manual/storage/storing-data/index.html[To store a newly created object, store the "owner" of the object].

NOTE: <<annotations, Micronaut EclipseStore annotations>> only work for synchronous methods. It does not do any logic for methods returning a `Publisher` or a `CompletableFuture`. For those scenarios, use directly the `StorageManager`.
