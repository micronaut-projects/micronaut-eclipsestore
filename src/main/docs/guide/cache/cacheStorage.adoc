If caching that persists across restarts is required, you can back a EclipseStore cache with a Storage Manager.

[configuration]
.src/main/resources/application.yml
----
include::test-suite/src/test/resources/application-cachepersist.yml[]
----

<1> Define a storage manager called `backing`
<2> Define a cache called `counter` to store Strings keys and Long values
<3> Configure the cache to use the `backing` storage manager

The above example will then persist across restarts.
